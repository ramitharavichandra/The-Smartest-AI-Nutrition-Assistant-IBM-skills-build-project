Capstone Project: The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant
Project Overview
The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant is an AI-driven system designed to provide personalized, context-aware nutrition planning. Built using IBM’s AI and cloud ecosystem, the project addresses the limitations of generic diet apps by offering tailored meal plans based on users’ health profiles, dietary preferences, and cultural contexts.
Problem Statement
Many individuals seek personalized nutrition guidance, but existing solutions often provide generic plans, lack adaptability, and fail to consider holistic lifestyle factors, cultural preferences, or health conditions. Additionally, dietitians face challenges in scaling personalized consultations due to time and resource constraints.
Proposed Solution
The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant uses advanced AI to deliver scalable, personalized nutrition recommendations. Key features include:

A chat-based interface to collect user data (age, gender, allergies, medical conditions, dietary preferences, and health goals).
Generation of daily/weekly meal plans tailored to nutritional needs and cultural preferences.
Explanations of recommendations, including macronutrient and micronutrient details.
Iterative refinement of plans based on user feedback.
Integration with IBM’s AI and cloud services for scalability and accuracy.

System Architecture

Frontend: Built with React.js for a responsive user interface, deployed via IBM Cloud App Services.
Backend:
IBM Granite Foundation Models (via Watson.ai): For natural language understanding and content generation.
IBM Watson Assistant: For conversational user interaction.
IBM Cloud Object Storage: For secure storage of meal plans and user data.
IBM Cloudant NoSQL Database: For storing user profiles, dietary logs, and feedback.


Deployment: Hosted on IBM Cloud, with API key integration for secure access.

Development Approach

Step 1: Initialized a sandbox project on IBM Cloud, ensuring a clean resource list.
Step 2: Configured project details and storage for user data.
Step 3: Associated runtime environments for AI model training and deployment.
Step 4: Initialized user profiles for personalized recommendations.
Step 5: Created and deployed the project using IBM’s Watson.ai platform.
Step 6: Integrated API keys for secure access and scalability.

Key Achievements

Successfully developed a functional AI nutrition assistant prototype.
Demonstrated the use of generative AI for personalized health solutions.
Presented the project to mentors, earning positive feedback and certification.

Future Scope

Integration with fitness wearables (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) for real-time diet adjustments.
Support for regional Indian diets and local languages.
AI-powered grocery list generator synced with local store availability.
Mobile app with voice-only mode for accessibility.
Real-time analytics dashboard for nutritionists.
